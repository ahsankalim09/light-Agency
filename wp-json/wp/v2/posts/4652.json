A great story captures the audience\u2019s imagination. It sticks, and it also sells. In today\u2019s digital age, the narrative landscape is shifting. Branded storytelling is less monologue and more dialogue, favoring engagement over just eyeballs. Stories happen across platforms, often in real-time. They weave in the emotional with the rational\u2014a significant departure from traditional advertising. And when they\u2019re authentic, relevant and reflect the needs and interests of target audiences, stories have the potential to break through and make genuine connections with the right people at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>The narrative itself has changed, and we are changing with it. Recent studies show that the attention span for millennials is 60% shorter than previous generations. That\u2019s no surprise&#8211;endless entertainment options, from smartphones to tablets to television have been with them since birth. And it\u2019s not only millennials that have been affected by digital technology. Since the year 2000, the average attention span has dropped from 12 seconds down to 8 (for reference, the average for a goldfish is 9 seconds). As our ability to pay attention continues to shrink, brands must figure out how to establish meaningful connections with their audiences and create loyalty\u2014quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some great examples of brands that are using stories to do just that:<\/p>\n<h2>GoPro<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to customer-driven storytelling, GoPro has a winning formula: customers use the product to show off what they personally can do with it, which in turn also shows off the product\u2019s capabilities. GoPro makes it easy for customers to put the spotlight on their stories and then features the best of the best online and in stores.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4700\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Storytelling-blog-images-1.jpg\" alt=\"brand storytelling\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Dollar Shave Club<\/h2>\n<p>Dollar Shave Club\u2019s homepage video quickly went viral and has become the gold standard to which all other explanatory videos aspire.

Here are a few to keep in mind when coming up with stories for your brand:<\/p>\n<h3>Be human<\/h3>\n<p>People don\u2019t necessarily bond with brands alone, but they can deeply connect with the humans who relay the brand\u2019s message. Having your founder, staffers and\/or customers help tell your story is a powerful way to accomplish this.<\/p>\n<h3>Show us, don\u2019t tell us<\/h3>\n<p>Tell someone five great reasons they should buy your product and they will remember nothing. Share a story about how you invented a product that quietly transformed an entire neighborhood in Pittsburgh, and they will remember the product, the name of the town and your URL. Visuals or not, illustrating your point through the narrative is much more powerful and memorable. Statistics tell. Branded storytelling sells.<\/p>\n<h3>Speak to your audience, not every audience<\/h3>\n<p>If you try to relate to everyone, you\u2019ll end up connecting with no one. Instead, focus on telling stories that communicate directly to your target. Spend time thinking about what they\u2019d want to hear and why. According to Seth Godin, the most effective stories match the worldview of a tiny audience\u2014and then that tiny audience spreads the story.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it simple<\/h3>\n<p>The most successful brand stories aren\u2019t complicated. They are straightforward and easy to \u201cget\u201d. Remember that you don\u2019t have to tell the WHOLE story, just the best part.<\/p>\n<p>Branded storytelling is an art that has the potential to transform your business. It can help you\u00a0increase brand loyalty, trust, and connect with customers in meaningful ways. In this multi-platform digital world, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach, and that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s magical about narrative today. You have the option to explore different methods of content creation and look to those around you for inspiration. Great stories are everywhere; you just need to be on the lookout for them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways we humans can use to communicate our thoughts and ideas.
