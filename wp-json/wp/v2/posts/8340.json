According to a 2019 Sparkbox <a href=\"https:\/\/designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com\/2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey<\/a> of in-house UX design system teams, two of the three factors that led to their success with UX design systems were having a dedicated maintenance team and developer added to the workflow.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We are sharing valuable information; so you learn about the benefits of building a UX design system, along with ways to get started. If you haven\u2019t already, check out our previous <a href=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/insights\/ux-design-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post<\/a>, \u2018UX Design Systems Drive Conversion.\u2019 It\u2019s a good place to start if you want an introduction to the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Build and sustain a UX design system with the right people to bring the concept to a substance. Here, we\u2019ve outlined a few team models that can help you best structure your own.<\/p>\n<h2>4 Types of UX Design Teams<\/h2>\n<p>Two incredible UX design system experts to help put things in perspective are Nathan Curtis and Jina Anne. Both have contributed to some really helpful models for putting together a team of people to manage systems of all sizes. In total, they are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solitary<\/li>\n<li>Centralized<\/li>\n<li>Federated<\/li>\n<li>Cyclical<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Curtis first stoked the conversation about UX design system teams in his <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/eightshapes-llc\/team-models-for-scaling-a-design-system-2cf9d03be6a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post<\/a>, &#8220;Team Models For Scaling A Design System&#8221; on Medium. There, he clearly presented three team types (solitary, centralized, federated) companies can use to build out their design system. Anne extended the scope of these models with the addition of a Cyclical team to help meet the needs of larger enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s understand the differences between these UX design system teams and how they might fit into your plan.<\/p>\n<h2>Party of One: The Solitary Team<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8344 size-medium\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" title=\"Solitary Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Solitary-Model-Illustration-by-Nathan-Curtis-300x300.png\" alt=\"Solitary Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first model, solitary, or what Curtis calls the \u201coverlord\u201d excludes the actual &#8216;team&#8217; part of the model. Just as it sounds, the overlord is a one-person show that dictates how the design system will evolve. The overlord unilaterally decides on the process, components, development, and design. While this sets the stage for the process to be predictable and controlled, it also limits the system\u2019s capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the solitary model tends to be pretty rigid. It\u2019s not flexible enough to provide structure or guidelines for new brands and products. Since many of today\u2019s brands need to span various applications and platforms to meet their customers\u2019 needs; it\u2019s likely this model represents a pretty outdated approach.<\/p>\n<h2>Centralized UX Design Team<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8341\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8341\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8341 size-medium\" title=\"Centralized Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Centralized-Model-Illustration-by-Nathan-Curtis-300x300.png\" alt=\"Centralized Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Centralized Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A centralized team benefits from the time and expertise of a dedicated UX design team of designers and developers to make and disseminate information about the system to everyone. This is great when you need to maintain focus on your ultimate goal. The core team works objectively to put the process together. They have a little affiliation to a particular component or process. The core team&#8217;s objectivity can work against them in some ways too. Their general knowledge makes them unaware of real-world applications privy to developers, user experience experts, marketers, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Though there is a greater representation of the components that need to go into the UX design system, there is less feedback from other players on how well the design system works for them. Your background players (department heads, managers, specialists) can have exclusive, first-hand knowledge on what components are necessary to serve a particular objective. For example, if your time to market is more important than unit price than your components will vary accordingly\u2014and so will the cost.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, the centralized team can\u2019t understand the limits and challenges of product designers and have little influence to negotiate more efficient product and system objectives.<\/p>\n<h2>Federated Team<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8343\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8343\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8343 size-medium\" title=\"Federated Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Federated-Model-Illustration-by-Nathan-Curtis-300x300.png\" alt=\"Federated Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federated Model Illustration by Nathan Curtis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Now we come to Curtis\u2019 third team model: federated teams. The federated team model helps resolve a lot of the setbacks encountered with solitary and centralized team models. Federate means to form a single centralized unit within which each organization keeps some internal autonomy. So in the case of a federated team, a diverse group of decision-makers and a representative, along with a sanctioned subset of designers and leaders collaborate on the system within a specific timeline. All decisions are made collectively.<\/p>\n<p>A federated UX design system team makes everyone&#8217;s needs part of the planning process. This flexibility helps the system scale to any size and any direction the company wants to take it in. And since so many people see the value in it; They become natural champions of it too.<\/p>\n<p>The number of players from this team type can make your project veer off track though. Like when off-the-cuff strategy sessions between team members lack documentation. That makes it hard to track development decisions. Or when only a few people get a say in a final development decision. Quick decisions rule\u2014especially when your project lives in an environment that is fast, and constantly evolving to the needs of so many.<\/p>\n<h2>But Wait, There\u2019s More<\/h2>\n<p>Designer and Design Systems Expert Jina Anne outlined her own team model, used with her peers at Salesforce. In her <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/salesforce-ux\/the-salesforce-team-model-for-scaling-a-design-system-d89c2a2d404b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article,<\/a> she shares how Salesforce uses a combination of both centralized and federated team models to build their own UX design system.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In an enterprise organization like ours, a centralized design systems team is not enough on its own; with this many key players involved and the large amount of ground we have to cover, we need an approach that is more sustainable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Enter the cyclical team type.<\/p>\n<h2>Cyclical Teams<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8342\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8342\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8342 size-medium\" title=\"Cyclical Model Illustration by Jina Anne\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Cyclical-Model-Illustration-by-Jina-Anne-300x196.png\" alt=\"Cyclical Model Illustration by Jina Anne\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cyclical Model Illustration by Jina Anne<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>With code reusability, consistency and increased design and development efficiency <a href=\"https:\/\/designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com\/2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listed<\/a> as the top three motivators to establishing a design system, this team model has a definite place in the design system process.<\/p>\n<p>The cyclical team model adds an extra subset of contributors who inform each other\u2019s work throughout the process. An \u201cecosystem&#8221; of app developers and partners, streamlines bugs and updates to the process \u2013in real-time. So as the design system informs the product design; the product design informs the design system. The two feed each other to optimum efficiency.<\/p>\n<h2>What UX design team works best?<\/h2>\n<p>With the right UX design team in place, you\u2019ll save a lot of time and money securing your company&#8217;s long-term success.\u00a0 At Isadora Agency, we dedicate ourselves to changing the way brands connect with audiences in the digital world.
