The brainstorming session is what really kicks off the entire web design and development process. This is where all the FUN really begins! At Isadora Design the web design process can&#8217;t begin until the brainstorming session has taken place with the client. Our clients often ask about this meeting and what actually takes place during the brainstorming session. We receive questions all the time such as the ones below:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.571em;\">\n<li>How do I prepare for the meeting?<\/li>\n<li>What should I bring to the meeting?<\/li>\n<li>What will we review?<\/li>\n<li>Who should I have attend?<\/li>\n<li>How long will the meeting last?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are all great questions so for clarification purposes let&#8217;s go over what really takes place during the session and see what we can do about answering all of these questions. First off make sure the final decision maker attends the meeting &#8211; it may sound obvious but it&#8217;s important to have buy in from more than just the assistant! Now the brainstorming session begins and here is where you will finally be able to put a face to the web design company you&#8217;ll be working with for the next few months. You&#8217;ll get to meet face to face with the project manager in charge of your website build. Most importantly here is where you&#8217;ll be able to share all your ideas, your vision and the purpose behind your new website. The primary target audience along with business needs and any marketing initiatives are reviewed. After all your new website should be an enormous component of any online marketing efforts. Maybe you have a logo that you really love and would like to use on the website? Maybe you want to discuss Social Media integration or management in depth? Or maybe you want to talk about the SEO optimization package for your website? Whatever it is, here is where you&#8217;ll be able to do it.<\/p>\n<p>For large scale web design and development projects you may even see some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/other\/best-website-designers-evolve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">web designers<\/a> who will actually collaborate during the web design phase. With Isadora Design it&#8217;s not uncommon to have our Marketing VP attend either! Depending on the complexity of the project the brainstorming session normally lasts between 60-90 minutes. It&#8217;s plenty of time to go over all the details and functionality of every page including the various deliverable items within the scope of the project. Of course you&#8217;ll likely have a small amount of homework you&#8217;ll be responsible for so bring a pen and pad of paper to jot down notes. During the web design process clients provide assets such as copy (text) and certain images for the website. Website assets such as all the business lingo, certain images or photography are all provided by the client. In addition, for an <a href=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/before-after\/razorusa-ecommerce-web-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eCommerce website<\/a> a list of products and product attributes, images and descriptions are also provided. Make a note of what specific assets are due and by what date so that you have plenty of time to prepare. Turning these assets in late may slow down the web design process and cause delays.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly you&#8217;ll sign the agreement to commence the work. This last step is what officially locks the client into the work calendar and makes it all official. Often times web design companies in high demand are booked for months in advance. So plan ahead and get started on your research and web design company selection early. Remember, brainstorming sessions are FUN and quite a learning experience &#8211; so immerse yourself in the experience and enjoy the creative collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not every web design company actually has a brainstorming session with the client &#8211; but every web design company should!
