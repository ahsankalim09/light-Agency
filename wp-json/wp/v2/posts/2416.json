Online video can be a great, relevant way to reach consumers across devices. What you need to determine is how to strategize the medium in a way that works best for your brand.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Take a look at our tips below to find what\u00a0works for your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Know Who\u2019s Watching<\/h2>\n<p>Americans spend more than 10 hours each month watching online video&#8211;a figure that has increased 60 percent from just three years ago (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/reports\/2015\/case-study-more-than-just-engaging.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nielsen<\/a>). Referring to a consumer profile can help you target the right viewers. This is especially important if you plan to post on social media, since audiences vary on each platform. Also, identifying the purpose of your video can help you figure out the type of format you need to create. Will you have seconds or minutes to convey your message? Where in their buying journey will your consumer be likely to view it? On a mobile device in a store? On their laptop or iPad? The answers will help make your content more relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Create Your Best Format<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of options when it comes to figuring out the type of online video that works best for your brand. Some popular ones are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explainer videos that respond to consumer questions or teach your consumers something about your brand;<\/li>\n<li>Narratives that promote an app, service or product;<\/li>\n<li>Video submissions culled from your subscriber- or fan-base<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your videos are meant to be instructive you may want a longer format that lives on your website or is emailed directly to subscribers. If you\u2019re looking to promote your brand through a specific narrative you might explore shorter, more creative formats meant for social. What works for one platform may not for another so learn the nuances. Another question to ask: will your video be live or pre-recorded? Platforms like Facebook, Periscope and now Instagram give brands the opportunity to broadcast live feeds centered around Q&amp;As, live events or behind the scenes footage.<\/p>\n<h2>How and When to Produce<\/h2>\n<p>Once you finalize the audience and format of your online video you\u2019ll want to figure out the best way to produce it and how often you\u2019ll post. Does you company have in-house talent that can write, record and produce? Or are you better off hiring professionals? Google reports that 6 in 10 YouTube subscribers would follow advice on what to buy from their favorite creator over their favorite TV or movie personality. Would your brand benefit from connecting with influencers who can produce videos or plug your brand?<\/p>\n<p>Your posting schedule will depend on your medium. Perhaps you\u2019ll want to post a short video every day to social. Maybe it makes sense to create a longer format weekly for your brand\u2019s YouTube channel. Either way, developing a schedule will help you stay consistent.<\/p>\n<h2>Promote and Track<\/h2>\n<p>The great thing about videos is that you can find lots of ways to repurpose the content across mediums. Scripts can be rewritten for blogs and clips can be shortened for social media. You can even create supplemental material like answers from your video\u2019s Q&amp;A session to share. However you disseminate your content, you\u2019ll want to have some kind of tracking in place. Services like Google Analytics, Bitly links or a custom tracking software will give insight into what your consumers are enjoying.<\/p>\n<p>Video is a proven way to capture and convert consumers. To do it right though, you need to have a plan. Understanding your consumer, the various video platforms and types of content you can produce will make your adoption of online video more successful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the increasing popularity of online video viewing, not to mention the incorporation of video to social sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, it\u2019s no surprise that 91 percent of businesses plan to increase or maintain their spending on video in 2016 (Wyzowl).
