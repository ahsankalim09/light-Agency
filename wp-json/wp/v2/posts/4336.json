Most of us can recall when LinkedIn mysteriously bombarded our contacts with emails. Probably the only thing more frustrating than the mass distribution of emails was the mass confusion \u2013 why did this happen? As it turned out, LinkedIn utilized tactics to get users to share Google account information during the <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@danrschlosser\/linkedin-dark-patterns-3ae726fe1462#.74flyapom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up process<\/a>. This incident has become a classic case of <a href=\"https:\/\/darkpatterns.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dark patterns<\/a>, a not so obvious form of UX strategy practiced by those whose goal is to exploit human behavior for alternative reasons.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4450 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_1.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, LinkedIn is a great social networking platform and their value easily overshadows some of the onboarding tactics displayed. But here\u2019s the thing: the line between what defines a dark pattern and a good strategic user experience is often very thin. As UX strategists and designers, how do we maintain our noble dedication to users while simultaneously coming up with creative ways to drive conversion? Put more simply, when does an idea or design become, well, dark?<\/p>\n<h2>Camouflaging Digital Ads<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most conspicuous types of dark patterns is known as \u201cdisguised ads\u201d. Disguised ads are sneaky web advertisements designed specifically to fool users into clicking them. One way to do this is to camouflage them with other elements of a webpage. Yahoo, for example, has utilized this tactic by intentionally designing ads to look exactly like article elements. In addition, the typical components of an ad are obscured: the \u201csponsored\u201d text is colored in faint gray font, and the ability to close the ad is only available on hover. It\u2019s clear that these virtual landmines were designed specifically for Yahoo\u2019s website, as these are not the typical digital ads seen on the web.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4454 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_2.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cDisguised ads\u201d can also imitate important calls-to-action. In the example below, the main call-to-action on the web page is a green download button. But which button is the real one? Notice that there are two neighboring ads that take on a strikingly familiar form. Both have the word \u201cdownload\u201d and an arrow facing downward, and both are colored in green, just like the real one. Suddenly, a simple task becomes confusing. Is this just a coincidence? Hardly. Dark pattern designers know that by making ads look like important elements, users will click on them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4456 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_3.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, this isn\u2019t to say that all ads are evil. Many companies use virtual ads to spread brand awareness and drive quality traffic to a web property. But spreading awareness should be done in a more honest and transparent fashion. The image below shows an example of a Microsoft Cloud \u201cdisguised ad\u201d on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes<\/a> website. This ad contains navigation arrows, elements that are commonly found on image carousels. As far as what the ad is trying to portray, these arrows serve absolutely no purpose. Yet, if your curiosity leads to you click on one of them, you\u2019ll immediately be launched into a Microsoft Cloud page.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4458 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_4.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Pushing Users to an Action\u2026Without Users Noticing<\/h2>\n<p>Dark patterns often take advantage of human psychology. What is the one thing that everyone dreads on the web? You guessed it: forms. No one likes to sit around filling out lengthy, life-impeding forms. Dark pattern practitioners understand this, and exploit this psychology in many ways. One of them is purposefully adding text in areas where users are least likely to pay attention. The example below shows the first page in Alibaba\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/accounts.alibaba.com\/register\/ifm_reg.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sign up form<\/a>. At first glance, it looks harmless. But as you approach the last step \u2013 the required checkbox that ensures users abide by a company\u2019s terms and policy \u2013 something odd happens. If you were treading carefully through this process, you would notice that the very last line states \u201cReceive emails related to Alibaba.com membership and services.\u201d The dark pattern? Agreeing to Alibaba\u2019s user agreement and receiving promotional emails are part of the same deal \u2013 you have no way to opt out of receiving emails if you wish to proceed to the next step. Most people would not care to notice, as it\u2019s carefully tucked under a very familiar looking \u201cagree to terms\u201d checkbox. But even if you did notice, what could you do? As a new user, you are coerced into receiving emails that you may have absolutely no interest in.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4460\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_5.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Not so optional selections<\/h2>\n<p>The last example in this post is known as a <a href=\"https:\/\/darkpatterns.org\/types-of-dark-pattern\/roach-motel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roach motel<\/a>. In a roach motel dark pattern, the design intentionally makes it very easy to get into a situation that is very hard to get out of. The \u201cAdd Holding Luggage\u201d functionality on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.easyjet.com\/EN\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> EasyJet\u2019s<\/a> website illustrates a classic example of this in the buy ticket flow. The process starts off like most travel sites: you fill out a form on the homepage, click a button, and arrive at a multi-step process that eventually leads you to the end of your transaction. However, things quickly start to look suspicious\u2026<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4462\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_6.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, EasyJet does not clearly communicate if the additional products are required. Title text such as \u201cAdd your flight options\u201d and \u201cSelect Seats\u201d make it seem more like required customization than optional purchases. The page is also crowded with orange call-to-action buttons, making it harder to discern the \u201cContinue\u201d button. Dark patterns have clearly started to flood in. It\u2019s also evident that EasyJet is trying to push the \u201chold luggage\u201d product out to the user as much as possible. On this page alone, it\u2019s mentioned in 3 locations in 3 different ways. It becomes obvious that accepting \u201cno\u201d for an answer is not what EasyJet encourages.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4464\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The real dark pattern occurs near the end of the buy ticket flow. In the \u201cYour Trip\u201d box on the Checkout page, a large black \u201cX\u201d crossing out a luggage icon immediately draws the user\u2019s attention. The text beside it reads \u201cPre-holding your hold luggage online is much cheaper than at the airport, and much less hassle.\u201d This seems like an obscure description. How much luggage can I pre-hold? How much would I be saving exactly? Why is this pre-hold luggage feature so important? Is there a luggage weight limit? With all these questions in mind, the user inevitably seeks answers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4466\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_8.jpg\" alt=\"dark patterns\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The only thread of hope is a mysterious \u201cAdd hold luggage\u201d link. Once clicked, however, the ultimate trap is activated. That\u2019s right \u2013 clicking this link adds the hold luggage fee to your total. You are now suddenly committed to paying a mysterious fee of $23.40. The only way to get out is to start the entire process over, but dark pattern designers know that people can be impatient, and that there is a good chance they will pay the price because they have invested the time and want to get the process over with.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4468\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Dark-Patterns_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Think of the user &#8211; stay transparent<\/h2>\n<p>With great power comes great responsibility. UX strategists and web designers alike have the ability to essentially create and influence the user\u2019s entire experience in various ways. So, it\u2019s our duty to put the user\u2019s interests and concerns in the forefront of everything we do. For the vast majority of us, even in tough times, the thought process needs to always include thinking about what is best for the user. When we start prioritizing business over the ones who give us business, the long-term effects may be devastating. Dark patterns may not always reveal themselves immediately. But sooner or later, they will always be exposed.<\/p>\n<p>Author \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rcreations\/\">Richard Chen<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 6138px; left: 20px;\">Save<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever been tricked by a website?
