The tablet has experienced a meteoric rise since the introduction of the iPad and now web design for iPad is all the rage. Ok, maybe tablets won&#8217;t rule the world entirely but the flood gates are open and there is no turning back folks! By now we should all be aware of the tablet&#8217;s enormous impact on the consumption and creation of data. Over 53 Million Americans already have a tablet and almost 200 Million tablets have been sold worldwide. I myself have two tablets and I think it&#8217;s an essential device to have around. In fact, I have one at the office and one in my car so basically I don&#8217;t leave home without one.<\/p>\n<div class=\"visual alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/isadoradigitalagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/ipad.jpg\" alt=\"web design for iPad \" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now when it comes to web design for iPads there are definitely a few things to consider. Designing websites for the iPad is something that more and more clients are requesting. The iPad has a screen resolution of 1024&#215;768 but that includes the bar showing the time and power level among other things. If your web page design stays within 980 pixels in width you should be ok. Any wider and you&#8217;ll end up with a much different layout that does not look right. Proper browser detection for the iPad and the iPhone is also important. You get the idea &#8211; when it comes to designing a high quality website these are factors that should be considered. Also keep in mind that Apple does not like Flash and so you will need to code your website using CSS3 and HTML5 for movement instead. Personally, I would avoid using flash entirely. Flash is old, has security issues and is terrible for SEO. In addition, there is nothing more frustrating than realizing your new flash website does not show up on an iPad or iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>When you consider the numbers and market trends designing for iPad is a MUST.\u00a0At Isadora Design we send our MBA graduates out to the field to gather intel. They also spend quite a bit of time searching and pursuing the latest business databases. Our web design company makes it a priority to stay ahead of the curve and that means keeping our eyes and ears open for all the latest and upcoming market trends. It&#8217;s always fun to see what types of information the research brings about. For instance, did you know that in 2012 $13.8 Billion in sales were purchased through the use of a tablet? Well that number is expected to nearly double in 2013! In 2012, US retail mobile commerce sales increased 81% to $24 Billion\u00a0(eMarketer &#8211; Record Retail Sales on smartphones and tablets). It&#8217;s clear that mobile devices including the iPad and mobile phones have become quite relevant in the digital shopping landscape. In fact not a month goes buy where I am not using my tablet or my phone to make an online purchase.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that we will continue to conduct the research to make sure our clients take advantage of the latest trends. For now what you need to know is that tablets and mobile devices are here to stay and these devices may have a huge impact on your bottom line. Consumers are very comfortable shopping and making those purchases online. Is your business website optimized for iPad and mobile devices?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is there any doubt left that tablets will one day rule the world?!
